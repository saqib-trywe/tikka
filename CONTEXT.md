# Context

Domain vocabulary for tikka. A glossary, not a spec: no implementation details, no
decisions. Decisions live on [the map](.wayfinder/MAP.md); architecture lives in ADRs.

## Project

A namespace for issues. Owns a short key (`TIK`) and the sequence that numbers them.
Projects do not nest and carry no configuration — they exist to scope ids and nothing
else.

A project's key is permanent and a project is never removed: the key is part of every
issue id ever issued. Its display name is just a label and may change.

### Bound project

The project a working context means when it names none — a repository directory, or an
agent's connection to tikka. Binding is set once, outside any conversation. Naming a
project explicitly always overrides it; with no binding, nothing is assumed.

## Issue

The unit of work, and the only substantial entity in tikka. An issue has a title, a
markdown body, a status, labels, an assignee, an optional parent, blocking edges,
comments, and timestamps.

There are no issue *types* — no epic, story, bug, or task. Labels carry every semantic
distinction, which keeps tikka ignorant of the vocabulary of whatever is using it.

### Issue id

A project key plus a monotonic integer: `TIK-42`. Assigned once, never reused, never
changed. Numbers increase in creation order; they are not promised to be gapless. Chosen to be speakable aloud and typeable into a command line.

### Version

A counter on each issue that moves only when its title, body or labels change. A writer
may state the version it last read; if the issue has moved on, the write is refused
rather than silently overwriting. Claims, comments, status changes and edges do not move
it — they have their own guards, or never conflict.

## Status

Exactly two values: `open` and `closed`. Nothing else is a status.

**In progress** is not a status. It is *derived*: an open issue with an assignee is in
progress. This is a deliberate refusal — a stored in-progress flag can drift out of
agreement with the assignee, and a derived one cannot.

**Reopening** returns a closed issue to open, discarding its resolution (the timeline
keeps it). Like closing, it always carries a comment saying why.

Issues are never deleted. Closing as `dropped` is the only way out, including for issues
created by mistake.

## Resolution

Recorded when an issue is closed. Either `done` (the work was carried out) or `dropped`
(the issue was closed without being carried out — abandoned, obsolete, or ruled outside
the scope of the effort).

The distinction matters because "we finished this" and "we decided not to" are different
facts about the route taken, and a single closed status loses the difference.

Closing always carries a comment saying why. A resolution records *what* happened; the
comment records the reasoning a later reader will need.

## Assignee

Free text naming whoever or whatever holds the issue. Not a reference to a user entity —
tikka has no users. An agent session and a human are the same kind of thing here.

## Claim

Taking an issue by setting its assignee, conditional on it having none. A claim
**fails** rather than overwrites when the issue is already assigned, which is what makes
it safe for concurrent sessions to race for the same work. Claiming an issue you already
hold is not a conflict: it succeeds and changes nothing.

An open issue with no assignee is **unclaimed**.

The assignee changes only by claiming, releasing, or reassigning — each conditional on
who holds it now:

- **Release** — the holder gives the issue up.
- **Reassign** — someone other than the holder moves the issue on, naming the holder they
  expect to displace. Reassigning to nobody clears the claim.

A **stale claim** is one held long enough that its holder has probably gone — typically an
agent session that ended mid-work. Claims never lapse on their own; a stale claim stays
until someone reassigns it.

A closed issue's assignee is history — the record of who resolved it — so a closed issue
cannot be claimed, released or reassigned. Reopen it first if the work is live again.

## Comment

A remark appended to an issue. Comments are only ever added, never edited or removed, so
two writers can never conflict over one.

## Edges

Exactly three kinds of relationship between issues. Parent and blocks edges only connect
issues in the same project; mentions may reach across projects.

### Parent

Structural hierarchy. An issue has at most one parent and any number of **children**.
Hand-set. Carries containment, not sequencing — a parent is not blocked by its children.

### Blocks

An issue **blocks** another when the second cannot proceed until the first is closed.
Hand-set, many-to-many, and acyclic: writes that would form a cycle are rejected.

An issue is **blocked** while any issue blocking it is still open, and **unblocked**
once all of them are closed.

### Mention

A reference to an issue id occurring in a body or comment. Mentions are **derived**, not
curated: writing `TIK-42` in prose creates the edge, and the mentioned issue gains a
**backlink**. There is no way to hand-author or hand-remove a mention.

This is the whole of tikka's "see also". Curated link types — *relates to*, *duplicates*,
*clones* — are deliberately absent; they go stale because nothing forces them to stay
true, whereas a derived edge cannot disagree with the text that produced it.

## Label

An opaque string attached to an issue. Tikka attaches no meaning to any label and
interprets none of them, including namespaced ones like `wayfinder:map`. Meaning belongs
to whoever is reading.

Labels are case-insensitive: `Bug` and `bug` are the same label.

## Rank

The position of an issue in a total order. Defaults to the issue's sequence number, so
order is deterministic without anyone setting it, and can be overwritten to reorder.

Rank is not priority. Tikka has no priority.

A rank is any decimal number, so an issue can be placed between two others (3.5 sits
between 3 and 4) without moving either.

Ranks need not be unique; issues with equal rank are ordered by issue number.

## Event

A record that something about an issue changed: who, when, which field, and from what to
what. Events accumulate and are never edited or removed, forming an issue's **timeline**.

An issue's current state is the authority on what is true now; the timeline is the record
of how it got there. They are separate on purpose.

One write is one event, however many fields it changes; a comment given with the write
belongs to that event. A write that changes nothing records no event.

An event belongs to the issue written to, and also appears on the timeline of every issue
whose parent or blocking edges it changed, or that it unblocked or blocked again — closing
a blocker shows on each dependent it frees. A **mention** does not carry an event onto the
mentioned issue — the backlink appears, the timeline stays quiet.

The event names **who** by the surface and client that made the write (an agent through
MCP, the CLI, the web UI), not by a person.

An issue's **updated** time is the time of the latest event on its timeline — a comment or
a claim updates an issue as much as a title change does.

## Ready

An issue is **ready** when it is open, unblocked, and unclaimed — work anyone could take
right now.

Consumers may have their own word for a scoped slice of ready work (wayfinder calls its
version the *frontier*); tikka does not adopt those words.
